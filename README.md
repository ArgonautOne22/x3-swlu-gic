# Galaxy in Chaos addon for Star Wars: Litcubes Universe, a mod for X3: Albion Prelude.
## An addon for a mod for a mod for a DLC that was originally a mod for a game that was originally a mod for X3: Reunion. Try saying that five times fast.

Development version 1.1.5 for SWLU 1.3.2.

Galaxy in Chaos (hereafter referred to as GiC) attempts to recreate the Star Wars galaxy as a proper setting for the respective modification of Litcube's Universe. The entire layout of the map is redone from scratch.
The `main` branch of GiC serves to recreate the Galactic Civil War setting, pitting the Rebel Alliance and its SecForces against the Galactic Empire and its remnant factions.
The other races of the X-Universe have become minor factions in the Galactic Civil War, or have been placed such that their inclusion could be plausibly included lore-wise.

# The Map

## Map Dynamics
As opposed to the vanilla LU map, the Star Wars galaxy includes many isolated sectors and enclaves. In addition, there are multiple hotzones where ships will invade enemy sectors within certain areas similar to Heretic's End and the Republic Holdout in vanilla SWLU.
GiC also introduces random invasion fleets, which function the same except these fleets can invade any enemy sector, and are not limited to a strict set of sectors/hot zones. This unpredictability makes salvaging and exploring much more engaging, but also makes the game significantly more challenging as the player is rarely truly safe from the war.


# New Features
There are several new unrelated additions to the mod.
## Jump Beacon Factories
In vanilla, jump beacons are not producable and wind up being consumed gradually from sale in military docks over the course of the game. The factory allows for a player to acquire jump beacons without abusing the litcube import/export feature.
## The Event System 
GiC features its own event system that provides away for the dynamic between factions in the galaxy to change. Currently, it allows for the major and minor factions to change war states, but will not stop the ongoing civil war. There are also 2 event chains in the mod.
This event system however is really buggy and as it runs through the AL engine is made to be turned off if needed. A rewrite is planned.
## Faction Attacks (Misc. AL Plugin)
To further reinforce the dynamic map and higher difficulty, and the fact that the player is in the middle of a war, enemy factions may occasionally jump ships and fleets to attack the player directly. The size of attack fleets increases with the amount of ships and stations owned by the player.
## The Battle of Endor (Misc. AL Plugin)
In GiC 1.1.4 and prior versions, there was a continuous battle for Endor that would occur throughout the entire game. For the sake of performance and consistency, the battle for endor is now scripted. A message will appear when the player reaches sufficient notoriety with the Empire or Rebels notifying when the battle can begin.

# Balance Changes
There are several balance changes, mostly to ships and weapons.
## Lasers
Most lasers fire faster. There are also several new lasers added by the mod that attempt to fill the gaps in the vanilla laser set that would help fit in more with star wars lore.
## New Ships
New ships are made as variants to existing ships added by the mod. There is currently 1 custom ship added by the mod: The Marauder Artillery Platform.
## Modified Ship Loadouts
Existing ships from certain races have had their available laser armaments altered to fix issues in the base mod and to adhere more to what makes sense time period wise.
For example, the Old Republic faction no longer has access to the Fusion Beam Cannon/Photon Pulse Cannon/Ion Cannon as they have been given alternatives to fit the theme of their ships being ancient.
## Salvaging
In GiC 1.1.4, GiC's ship bail rate was decreased in accordance with SWLU 1.2.9's changes. In SWLU 1.3, Capital ships were allowed to bail, however considering GiC's salvage heavy gameplay and general increase in space battles across the map, this change has not been carried over, and capital ships cannot bail in GiC.
